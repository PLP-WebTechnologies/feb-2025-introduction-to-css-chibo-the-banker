        Carbon emmissions increase the carbon footprint of a company,
        marginally. The company can reduce their carbon footprint by taking part
        in environmentally friendly exercises or simply by buying carbon
        credits. Carbon credits allow a company to buy a certificate from an
        entity taking part in environmentally friendly activities that combat
        climate change. These activities can be planting trees, using up waste.
